          The Institute for Research and Innovation in Intelligent Systems (IRIIS) was founded with a purpose rooted in shared experience and vision: we’ve witnessed the challenges that students and aspiring researchers face in regions where research opportunities are limited. In countries like Nepal, students who want to study advanced fields such as computer science, artificial intelligence, and conduct research studies often find a lack of pathways, guidance, and resources to support their journey. IRIIS exists to change that narrative and help build a strong foundation of knowledge, innovation, and research access.

        At IRIIS, our mission is to cultivate an environment for learning and discovery. While we may not yet be complete experts, we started this journey with the understanding that everything begins with a first step. We are committed to continuous learning and improvement, aiming to enhance our capabilities day by day. 
        </p>
        <p className="text-2xl  mt-8">
        Our team draws significant inspiration from the success of NAAMII, Nepal's pioneering AI research organization, as well as from influential educators: Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown) and Prof. Chris Piech.
